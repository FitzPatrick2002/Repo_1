git version -> gives you the current installed version
git config --global user.name FitzPatrick1978
git config --global user.email miloszlini@gmail.com

mkdir newDir -> make a new direcotry 'newDir' in current folder 
git init -> initializes empty git repository in newDir/.git

//After initialisation of directory I can push stuff to it
	git remote add origin https://github.com/FitzPatrick2002/Repo_1.git 
-> I gueass that I'm adding this specific remote repository to the origin file or smth and now git will push all I want to this specific repository

git branch -M main -> renames the 'master' to 'main' branch

	git push -u origin main -> pushes the main branch to origin, withou -u it wouldn't know with which branch to merge in case we had many

//The idea with branching

- We have the main project
- We want to make a change -> create a separate branch
- There is an error in the change
- Make another branch fixing this problem
- merge the small error fix branch with the new-design branch
- As the work is done with the new feature merge the new-design with the main branch

git branch br_1 -> creates a new branch br_1
git branch -> shows all available branches
git checkout br_1 -> moves us to br_1 branch

- If we create anything in the file explorere it will be saved into the branch br_1 

git checkout main -> we come back to the main branch
git merge br_1 -> we are merging br_1 with the current branch (main)

git add --all -> adds all to staging env. (new ones, changes, everything)
git commit -a -m "asasa" -> -a means to automatically stage tracked and modified files without using 'git add', -m addes message
